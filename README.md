Project to identify a set of Human Actionson 2d images
Using dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/human-action-recognition-har-dataset/data
# What is HAR?
Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data.
Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting
# Why is important?
Human activity recognition plays a significant role in human-to-human interaction and interpersonal relations.
Because it provides information about the identity of a person, their personality, and psychological state, it is difficult to extract.
The human ability to recognize another personâ€™s activities is one of the main subjects of study of the scientific areas of computer vision and machine learning. As a result of this research, many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system.
# Notebooks
1. first iteration with 97% accuracy but overfitting present - human-action-recognition-har
2. final attempt with 81% accuracy and better generalization. - human-action-recognition-har-v2
# Future works
- Add heat map to images
- Add more epochs and more layers depending on resources available
# Data
- Data is available on both of the notebooks, on step 1 they're copied from github to the resources of the notebook instance. 
- Everything shown on the video is reproducible.

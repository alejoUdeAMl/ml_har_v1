# What is HAR?
Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data.
Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting
# Why is important?
Human activity recognition plays a significant role in human-to-human interaction and interpersonal relations.
Because it provides information about the identity of a person, their personality, and psychological state, it is difficult to extract.
The human ability to recognize another personâ€™s activities is one of the main subjects of study of the scientific areas of computer vision and machine learning. As a result of this research, many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system.
